# TowerDefenceGame
My second attempt of following Brackeys' tutorial

This is a Tower Defence Game clone. Objective is simple kill any enemy to block their way to the end of a fixed path. You need to ranged attack via raising towers. 

At the very start of the game player can build 3 types of Tower: 1)bullet tower  2)Missile tower  3)Laser Tower

Missile tower has increased range and power however what lacks is the speed of fire. Oh also it attacks like AD(Area Damage)

Laser tower is the most expensive tower but it is worth it. It attacks continues growing damage.

If one of the enemy make pass of your defences its game over and player prompted with a menu
